First and formost use a non-priviledged account - NOT ROOT!!

I tend to use the user tos (Telos Operational Signer) and has home directory of /data

So as user tos:
mkdir {NewStage}
cd NewStage
gitclone https://github.com/Telos-Foundation/telos --recursive
cd telos
git checkout (current tag)
./telos_buils.sh
cd build make
cd ../..
mkdir nodeos (or your producer name, etc)
I then copy ..{OldStage}/config.ini nodeos/
cd nodeos
edit config.ini to change ports for this stage and point p2p to this stage endpoints
download new genesis.json file
./start.sh
